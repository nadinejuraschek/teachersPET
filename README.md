### Project Goals

The goal for this project was to make it easier for teachers to keep track of classes and students, including student information and individual progress within the class. We want to be able to use the Google calendar to input homework due dates, parent-teacher meetings, school events, etc.

### Motivation

Our motivation was first to do something with education somehow. We knew we wanted a project that made it easier for students or teachers.
Thus we decided on an organizer for teachers to be able to keep track of classes and students.
